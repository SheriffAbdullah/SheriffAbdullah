Hi, my name is Abdullah Sheriff.

I am a problem-solver. I work with startup-founders on problems across ML, DBs, UI/UX, Design, Hiring, & anything that requires problem-solving. 

I love working on impactful projects that are at least useful to me, e.g. 
* My [NoteSite](https://abdullahsheriff.vercel.app) is actively used by 500+ students at SNUC.
* Bronze-medal [NEET dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahshf/neet-ug-2024-results-all-india) on Kaggle.
